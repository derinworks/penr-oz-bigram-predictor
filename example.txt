Title: The Whispering Clock

The old clock in the hallway had not chimed in years. Dust gathered thick on its wooden face, and the brass hands
pointed stubbornly to midnight. No one in the house remembered when it had stopped, only that it never started again.

Every night, just before the wind curled through the windows, the silence would stretch long and heavy. On some nights,
if you listened closely, the clock whispered. Not in ticks or tocks, but in soft syllables — as though it had secrets to
tell, too old and tired to keep them anymore.

Ellie was the first to hear it. A faint murmur, like a name half-remembered. She stood before it in the dark, her hand
hovering over the glass. The whispers paused, as if it knew she was there.

She didn’t speak of it to anyone. But each night, she returned, letting the whispers thread into her dreams — words from
a time forgotten, waiting to be heard again.
